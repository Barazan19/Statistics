# ðŸ§ª Flu Drug Statistical Analysis

This repository walks through a complete statistical analysis pipeline for testing a new flu drug, using a StatQuest-inspired narrative.

## Sections

1. **P-Value Test** â€“ Determine if the new drug significantly reduces viral count.
2. **Statistical Power** â€“ Understand the strength of the test in detecting a real effect.
3. **Power Analysis** â€“ Calculate the required sample size to design a powerful experiment.
4. **FDR Correction** â€“ Control false discoveries when testing the drug against multiple viruses.

Each section is supported by Python code and practical simulation.

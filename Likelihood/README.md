## ✅ Summary

| Concept       | What varies?        | Used for                         | Example Question |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| Probability   | Data                 | Predicting outcomes               | “What’s the chance of 7 heads if p = 0.5?” |
| Likelihood    | Parameter            | Estimating model parameters       | “Given 7 heads, what’s the best estimate of p?” |

---

## 📈 Visualization Example

The likelihood function for 7 heads in 10 tosses helps us identify that the most likely value of `p` is `0.7`.

Happy learning and exploring! 🚀

| Concept         | Varies?         | Used For                         | Example Question                                  |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Probability       | Data             | Predicting outcomes              | “What’s the chance of 7 heads if p = 0.5?”        |
| Likelihood        | Parameter        | Estimating parameters            | “Given 7 heads, what’s the best estimate of p?”   |
| Log-Likelihood    | Parameter        | Optimization-friendly estimation | “Which \( \beta \) makes data most likely?”    |
